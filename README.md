# A-Data-Science-Toolbox
Design a data science toolbox to implement the data processing and machine learning algorithm

toolbox.py includes the details for data processing and machine learning algorithms designed from scratch
Data Science Toolbox Project -summary report.pdf file explains brief summary for all algorithms  

test.py is used to test all algorithms with provided datasets.

For datasets, there are used to test algorithms in test.py file
